# UD=>LFG
A converter from the UD annotation scheme of the Hamburg Dependency Treebank (UD) into LFG f-structures.

This is a work-in-progress piece of coursework for my degree in linguistics which converts Universal Dependency annotation stored in a CoNLL-U file format into f-structures well-formed according to a Lexical Functional Grammar framework. Contained are the relevant Python scripts, a sample from the HDT-UD and my conversion of that sample, which had a successs rate of 98.28%. Some data is yet to be added, most notably structure-sharing. Some of the conversions are atypical for reasons I will discuss in a forthcoming report.
