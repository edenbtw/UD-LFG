# ud-lfg
A converter from the UD annotation scheme of the HDT-UD into LFG f-structures.

This is a work-in-progress piece of coursework for my degree in linguistics which converts UD annotation stored in a CoNLL-U file format into f-structures
well-formed according to a Lexical Functional Grammar framework. The end result of the project will be a conversion of the Hamburg Dependancy Treebank into
f-structures, and the implementation of functions that return valid antecedants for anaphorically bound pronouns to demonstrate this conversion's utility
in a potential semantic corpus study.

Conversions for clausal modifiers, expletive subjets and copulars are yet to be implemented. The conversion will be finished some time before June.
